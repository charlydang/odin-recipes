    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Bake in air fryer at 190Â°C for 10 minutes. Turn over and bake for 5 minutes.
    (Please adjust the temperature and time according to the air fryer.)</li>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients for sauce in a microwave container.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and  microwave for 40sec ~ 1 min</li>
        <li>Insert the pikachu on the skewer and apply the sauce(Please adjust the amount of sauce according to your preference)</li>
        <li>Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. </li>
        <li>Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
